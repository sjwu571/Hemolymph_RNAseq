Figure 1. Experimental timeline. Hemolymph from fifty Pacific oysters (Magallana gigas) was sampled at four time points (black arrows) on days: 22 (T0), 36 (T1), 51 (T2), and 79 (T3) of an artificial gonad conditioning period. All oysters were phenotypically sexed on day 99 (white arrow). Y-axis is water temperature (Â°C).
